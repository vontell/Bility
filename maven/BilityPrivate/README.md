This repository contains the Bility library for Android, an open source project devoted to making
accessibility on mobile applications easier through automation and customization.

Maintained and developed by the Decentralized Information Group at MIT's CSAIL.

## Current Features

Below is a list of features that the AMA library currently supports ease of:

1. Applying dyslexic-optimal fonts
2. Increasing font sizes
3. Applying different fonts
4. Increase whitespace / padding between views
5. Obtaining contrast between foreground and background colors
6. Determining level of WCAG-defined contrast that is met between two colors
7. Marking views as being navigated using speech
8. Marking views with a "connotation", such as dangerous, successful, warning, etc...
9. Marking views with a "helper" object to be used by components such as instruction holders

## Other Useful Functions

Below is a list of other helper functions built within the library that you may find useful for
use in other projects besides accessibility.

1. Obtaining a list of every View and / or TextView within a given View / ViewGroup
2. Obtaining a list of every String contained within a View (from TextView objects)
3. Common interface for internal and external Android storage
