# Additional Projects
The following is a list of spin-off projects that can be completed based off the work done within 
the Bility project.

## Bility Development Library
With the ability to view accessibility issues, we might be able to recommend code and changes that
can tackle some of the issues directly. Providing a library that makes it easy to accomplish these
accessibiltiy bug fixes would be incredibly helpful.

## Privacy
Being able to detect a user's behavior and configure accessibility features automatically would be
extremely powerful, but privacy issues surround the storage of disability-related information. We
should look into this.

## Media-based Accessibility Testing
Testing the accessibility of time-based media (video and audio) and static media (images) is difficult
but important. It would be great to setup a framework, processing, and other infra for doing
these kinds of analyses.

## AQuA + Silver + WCAG
The current testing framework detects a susbset of issues discussed in WCAG 2.0. However, there are
multiple accessibility frameworks that have great rules to test for. We should support more of these
detections.

## Text Summarization
Users with cognitive disabilities may have difficulty reading long and difficult text, but text
can be summarized and reduced in length through natural language processing techniques.

## Parkinson's Testing
Users with Parkinsons often have trouble clicking and navigating applications, due to lack of motor
control. Being able to determine when a "double/triple click" is meant as one click would be extremely
helpful with Parkinsons users.

## Learned-based Navigation
Projects such as RICO and ERICA provide great datasets for learning-based models of navigation (i.e.
input is a UI, output is a user action). Maybe we can use this to build out a contextual, learn-based
navigation AI.
